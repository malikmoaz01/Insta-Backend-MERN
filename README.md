Instagram Backend Using MERN Stack

Overview:
This repository contains the backend implementation for a simplified version of Instagram using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides a RESTful API to manage users, posts, likes, comments, and other functionalities typically found in a social media application.

Features:

    User Management: Allows users to sign up, sign in, edit their profile, and delete their account.
    
    Post Management: Enables users to create, view, update, and delete posts. Posts can include images, captions, and other metadata.
    
    Like and Comment: Users can like posts and add comments to them, enhancing engagement and interaction.
    
    Follow and Unfollow: Supports following and unfollowing other users to stay updated with their posts.
    
    Feed: Generates a personalized feed for each user, displaying posts from users they follow.
    
    Search: Provides search functionality to find users and posts based on keywords or hashtags.

Technologies Used:

    MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store user data, post data, and other related information.
    
    Express.js: Web application framework for building robust and scalable backend APIs.
    
    React.js: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, used for the frontend (not included in this repository).
    
    Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
    
    Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
    
    JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure method for transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user authentication and authorization.
    
    bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords securely before storing them in the database.
    
    Express Validator: Middleware for Express.js used to validate incoming requests and sanitize user input.
